title: Inferring causation from time series in Earth system sciences

  The heart of the scientific enterprise is a rational effort to understand the causes behind the phenomena we observe. In large-scale complex dynamical systems such as the Earth system, real experiments are rarely feasible. However, a rapidly increasing amount of observational and simulated data opens up the use of novel data-driven causal methods beyond the commonly adopted correlation techniques. Here, we give an overview of causal inference frameworks and identify promising generic application cases common in Earth system sciences and beyond. We discuss challenges and initiate the benchmark platform causeme.net to close the gap between method users and developers.

This paper describes why causal inference from non-experimental time series data is desirable and under which assumptions it is possible. It is meant as an introductory text on causal inference providing an overview of a range of competing frameworks. Often choosing an intervention is the primary motivation of statistical modelling, and therefore, this topic might be interesting for our group. Also, some group members showed repeatedly interest in this subject. A PhD-student in this field suggested this paper; it is recent but accessible and fairly short (20min reading time). Therefore an ideal entry point for us into the topic.
