### [Inferring causation from time series in Earth system sciences (Runge, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10105-3)

This describes why causel inference from non-experimental time series data is desirable and under which assumptions it is possible. It is meant as a introductory text on causal inference providing an overview about a range of competing frameworks. Often choosing an intervention is the main motivation of statistical modelling and therefore this topic might be intresting for our group. Also some group members showed repeadetly interest in the topic. This paper was suggested by a Phd-student in this field, is recent but accessable and fairly short (20min reading time). Therefore an ideal entrypoint for us into the topic.

*Please note: We had not had the time to vote on this, we are going to read it anyways.*

Reading time: 20min

Format: paper
